A Head Full Of Dreams
oh I think I landed
in a world I hadn’t seen
when I’m feeling ordinary
when I don’t know what I mean

oh I think I landed
where there are miracles at work
for the thirst and for the hunger
come the conference of birds

saying it’s true, it’s not what it seems
leave your broken windows open
and in the light just streams
and you get a head, a head full of dreams
you can see the change you wanted
be what you want to be
and you get a head, a head full of dreams
into life I’ve just been spoken
with a head full, a head full of dreams

oh I think I landed
where there are miracles at work
when you got me open-handed
when you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I’ve just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Birds
been standing in the corner
studying the lights
the dreaming of escape will keep you up at night
but someone had put the flares up
and got me in the rays
so I guess I’d better stay
‘uh uh no come on’ you say

it’s a fool’s gold thunder
it’s just a warring rain
don’t let the fears just start ‘what if
I won’t see you again’
around here you never want to sleep all night
so start falling in love, start the riot and

come on rage with me
we don’t need words
and we’ll be birds
got to make our own key

only got this moment
you and me
guilty of nothing
but geography

come on and raise it
come on and raise this noise
for the million people
who got not one voice
come on it’s not over if you
mean it say loud
come on all for Love
out from the underground
away with me
we don’t need words
close your eyes and see
and we’ll be birds
flying free
holding on in the mystery

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
fearless together
you said ‘we’ll go through this together’
when you fly won’t you
won’t you take me too?
in this world so cruel
I think you’re so cool

Hymn For The Weekend
oh angel sent from up above
you know you make my world light up
when I was down, when I was hurt
you came to lift me up

life is a drink and love’s a drug
oh now I think I must be miles up
when I was a river dried up
you came to rain a flood

you said ‘drink from me, drink from me’
when I was so thirsty
poured on a symphony
now I just can’t get enough
put your wings on me, on me
when I was so heavy
poured on a symphony
when I’m low low low low

I oh I oh I
got me feeling drunk and high
so high so high
oh I oh I oh I
now I’m feeling drunk and high
so high so high

oh angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
life is a drink and your love’s about
to make the stars come out

put your wings on me, on me
when I was so heavy
poured on a symphony
when I’m low low low low

I oh I oh I
you got me feeling drunk and high
so high so high
oh I oh I oh I
now I’m feeling drunk and high
so high so high

I oh I oh I
la la la la la la la
so high so high

oh I oh I oh I
now I’m feeling drunk and high
so high so high
that I shoot across the sky
that I shoot across the
that I shoot across the sky
watch me shoot across the…..

Everglow
oh they say people come, say people go
this particular diamond was extra special
and though you might be gone, and the world may not know
still I see you, celestial

like a lion you ran,  a goddess you rolled
like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
so how come things move on, how come cars don’t slow
when it feels like the end of my world
when I should but I can’t let you go?

but when I’m cold, cold
oh when I’m cold, cold
there’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
there’s a feeling you give me, an everglow

like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
and we swore on that night we’d be friends til we die
but the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
life as short as the falling of snow
and now I’m gonna miss you I know

but when I’m cold, cold
in water rolled, salt
I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
and you’re with me wherever I go
and you give me this feeling this everglow

oh- I I I I
what I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
yeah I live for this feeling this everglow

so if you love someone, you should let them know
oh the light that you left me will everglow

Adventure Of A Lifetime

like I’m alive again
alive again

gonna hold up half the sky and say
only I own me

I feel my heart underneath my skin
oh I can feel my heart beating
cause you make me feel
like I’m alive again
alive again

Fun
I know it’s over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it’s over
An ocean awaits for a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it’s over, a parting of ways
And it’s done
But didn’t we have fun?
Don’t say it was all a waste
Didn’t we have fun
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh ah, ooh ooh ooh
Now we’re stopping the world
stopping its spin
but come on don’t give up don’t say we give in
Don’t say it’s over
Don’t say we’re done
Ah didn’t we have fun?

I know it’s over
Before she says
‘Know someone else has taken your place’
‘I know it’s over’
Icarus says to the sun
The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight til it’s over
Fight til it’s done
Oh oh oh oh oh
But didn’t we have fun?
Don’t say it was all a waste
Didn’t we have fun?
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost,
We would have been saved
Oh AH ah ah ah
Now we’re stopping the world
Stopping in its tracks but
Nothing’s too broken to find a way back
So before it’s over
Before you run
Ah ah
Didn’t we have fun?

Cause you and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to always meant to

You and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be

Wooh ooh ooh ooh oo ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
oh oh didn’t we have fun?

But then
Maybe we could again

Kaleidoscope
this being human is a guest house
every morning a new arrival
a joy, a depression, a meanness
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor

welcome and entertain them all!

be grateful for whoever comes
because each has been sent
as a guide

Army Of One
Been around the world
The wonders to view
Been around the world
Looking for someone like you
Pyramids try
Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die
Aim never untrue
I’m never so high as when I’m with you
And there isn’t a fire that I wouldn’t walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world
The universe too
I’ve been around flying, baby
It’s nothing I wouldn’t do
Tanzaku stars
Lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you right
When the storm comes through

Cause I never say die
Aim never untrue
Never so high as when I’m with you
And there isn’t a fire
That I wouldn’t walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

Cause you reign
All cause you reign
All cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
It’s my only weapon, army of one
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one

Amazing Day
We sat on a roof, named every star
shared every bruise and showed every scar
hope has its proof put your hand in mine
Life has a beautiful crazy design

and time seemed to say
Forget the world and its weight
And here I just want to stay
Amazing day amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
you showed me a place where you can be what you are

And the view, the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms I just want to sway
Amazing day amazing day
Amazing day amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh

and I asked
Can the Birds in poetry chime?
can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?
oh thanks God, must have heard when I prayed
cause now I always want to feel this way
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today

Up&Up
fixing up a car to drive in it again
searching for the water hoping for the rain
up and up, up and up
down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
up and up, up and up
see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
see a bird soaring high above the flood
it’s in your blood, it’s in your blood
underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
sitting with the poison takes away the pain
up and up, up and up it’s saying

we’re going to get it get it together right now
going to get it get it together somehow
going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh
we’re going to get it get it together I know
going to get it get it together and flow
going to get it get it together and go
up and up and up

lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
up and up, up and up
how come people suffer how come people part?
how come people struggle how come people break your heart?
break your heart
yes I want to grow yes I want to feel
yes I want to know show me how to heal it up
heal it up
see the forest there in every seed
angels in the marble waiting to be freed
just need love just need love
when the going is rough saying

we’re going to get it get it together right now
going to get it get it together somehow
going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh
we’re going to get it get it together I know
going to get it get it together and flow
going to get it get it together and go
up and up and up

and you can say what is, or fight for it
close your mind or take a risk
you can say it’s mine and clench your fist
or see each sunrise as a gift

we’re going to get it get it together right now
going to get it get it together somehow
going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh
we’re going to get it get it together I know
going to get it get it together and flow
going to get it get it together and go
up and up and up

we’re going to get it get it together right now
going to get it get it together somehow
going to get it get it together and flower
oh oh oh oh oh oh
we’re going to get it get it together I know
going to get it get it together and flow
going to get it get it together and go

up and up and up

oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh

fixing up a car to drive in it again
when you’re in pain
when you think you’ve had enough
don’t ever give up
don’t ever give up
