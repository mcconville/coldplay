Always In My Head
I think of you, I haven't slept
I think I do but I don't forget
My body moves, goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves, just won't be led
And so my mouth waters to be fed

And you're always in my head
You're always in my head

This I guess is to tell you
You're chosen out from the rest

Magic
Call it magic
Call it true
I call it magic
When I'm with you
And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic
When I'm next to you

And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
No, I don't it's true
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No, I don't it's true
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Want anybody else but you

Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic
I disappear from view
And I can't get over
Can't get over you
Still I call it magic
Such a precious jewel

And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
No, I don't it's true
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No, I don't it's true
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
Want anybody else but you

Want to fall, fall so far
I want to fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it magic

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic?
Yes, I do
Of course I do

Ink
Got a tattoo said 'together thru life'
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up will it be alright
Feels like there's something broken inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's alright
Just want a way of keeping you inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours and I'm dying of thirst
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

True Love
For a second I was in control
I had it once I lost it though
And all along the fire below would rise
And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

Tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Oh lie to me

Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
A fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

So tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Oh lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Oh lie to me
If you don't then lie
Oh lie to me

Call it true, call it true love
Call it true, call it true love

Midnight
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light a light on
Leave a light a light on

In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light a light on
Leave a light a light on

Anotherâ€™s Arms
Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms another's arms

Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me?
Or someone there to find me?

When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms another's arms
And that's just torture to me
Another's arms another's arms
Pull yourself into me
Another's arms another's arms
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms another's arms

Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms another's arms

Late night watching TV
Wish that you were here beside me
Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body

Oceans
Wait for your call love
The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
And I'm ready for it all love
Ready for the pain
Meet under sun and
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain

Behind the walls love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all love
I'm ready for the change
Meet me in blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain, the rain, the rain

Got to find yourself alone in this world
To find yourself alone

A Sky Full Of Stars
Cause you're a sky cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
Cause you're a sky cause you're a sky full of stars
Cause you light up the path

And I don't care go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

Cause you're a sky cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms
Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart

And I don't care go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

Cause in a sky cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

Cause you're a sky you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view

O
Flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
Fly on

Flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise, following them up
Still I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
Fly on

Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
