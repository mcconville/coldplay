Parachutes quickly shot to number one in the United Kingdom, staying in the top ten for thirty-three weeks.\n\nThe album produced four hit singles: \"Shiver\", \"Yellow\", \"Trouble\", and \"Don't Panic\". In the United States, the album peaked at only fifty-one on the Billboard 200 yet, it still managed to sell over two million copies within a year.\n\nParachutes won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2002. It was placed at #14 in Channel 4's 100 greatest albums of all time and in 2006 at #33 in NME's 100 greatest British albums. Despite the album's critical and commercial success, lead singer Chris Martin said that Coldplay looks beyond Parachutes. \"We know that's terrible music,\" he said, \"and we always try to think about what we can do

It was as successful as, if not more than, its predecessor, Parachutes, debuting at #1 in the United Kingdom, moving 273,000 copies, and at #5 in the United States, moving 144,000 copies in the first week.\n\nThe album includes guitar-pop singles (In My Place, God Put a Smile upon Your Face), ballads (The Scientist, Warning Sign), and acoustic songs (Green Eyes). However, the U2-esque epic rock of the album's opening track Politik, the piano-driven Clocks, and the loud guitars of A Whisper were seen to extend the band's musical range. The album also had greater use of piano than Coldplay's debut album or that of many other rock bands popular at the time. Clocks, a song centered around a cyclic piano riff and included on the album only at the last minute, ultimately became the band's largest hit to date, earning the band a Grammy for Record of the Year.\n\nA Rush of Blood to the Head also won the 2002 Grammy for Best Alternative Album. The album received generally excellent reviews, and many critics considered it better than Coldplay's first album, Parachutes. In 2003, the album was ranked number 473 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn 2007, The National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame released a list of what they term \"The Definitive 200 Albums of All Time\".

The album, which features influences of electronic music, was produced by the band and British record producer Danton Supple. British record producer Ken Nelson was supposed to produce much of the album, however, many songs written during their sessions were ditched due to the band's dissatisfaction. The album's cover art is a combination of colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code. The code should mean \"X&Y\", but it is misspelled. It actually means \"X9Y\".\n\nThe album has been considered a landmark achievement of the band, topping many charts worldwide, including the United Kingdom and United States, the latter being their first. With accumulated sales of over 8.3 million units, X&Y is 2005's best-selling album worldwide. Reviews for the album were mixed; many critics felt X&Y fell short of its predecessor, A Rush of Blood to the Head. The album has spawned the singles \"Speed of Sound\", \"Fix You\", \"Talk\", \"The Hardest Part\", \"What If\", and \"White Shadows\".\n\nSpecial Dutch Edition\nThe Dutch edition contains a second disk with the following songs: \n\"Things I Don't Understand\"\n\"Proof\"\n\"The World Turned Upside Down\"\n\"Pour Me\" (live @ the Hollywood Bowl)\n\"Sleeping Sun\"\n\"Gravity\""],"releaseMonth":"June","releaseYear":2005,"link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%26Y"}],"mood":"","sytle":"","start":2005,"end":2008,"image":"xandy.svg","className":"","analysis":{"word_count":3119,"processed_language":"en","personality":[{"trait_id":"big5_openness","name":"Openness","category":"personality","percentile":0.5150671902031686,"raw_score":0.7498578586824916,"significant":true,"children":[{"trait_id":"facet_adventurousness","name":"Adventurousness","category":"personality","percentile":0.8363947241041245,"raw_score":0.539663461165307,"significant":true},{"trait_id":"facet_artistic_interests","name":"Artistic

The 11-track album (with an additional hidden track called \"X Marks The Spot\") was recorded in LA and London, and was produced by Stargate and Rik Simpson. It features contributions from Beyoncé, Noel Gallagher, Tove Lo and Merry Clayton. Lead singer, Chris Martin, explained that as the band didn't tour with the previous album (Ghost Stories) they were able to start work quickly on their 7th album “Head Full of Dreams”. The first single released from the album on November 6, 2015 was \"Adventure of a Lifetime\".
