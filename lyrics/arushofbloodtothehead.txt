Politik
Look at earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place

Give me real, don't give me fake

Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Give me one, 'cause one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

In My Place
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under-prepared
But I wait for it

And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

God Put A Smile Upon Your Face
Where do we go? Nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've got to say I wasted all your time
Honey honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

Ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to
Ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace,
And put a smile upon your face ah yeah

Ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out I want it to
Ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

It's as good as mine

It's as good as mine

As good as mine, as good as mine
As good as mine, as good as mine

Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when

The Scientist
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

Clocks
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are

And nothing else compares
Oh nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go

Daylight
To my surprise
And my delight
I saw sunrise
I saw sunlight

I am nothing
In the dark
And the clouds burst
To show daylight

Oooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Oooh, come apart without it

On a hilltop
On a sky-rise
Like a firstborn
Child

And at full tilt
And in full flight
Defeat darkness
Breaking daylight

Oooh, and the sun shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who cannot live without
Oooh, come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through a daylight

Green Eyes
Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

The green eyes
Yeah the spotlight
Shines upon you

And how could anybody
Deny you?

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you

And honey you should know
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you

Honey you should know
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand

Warning Sign
A warning sign
I missed the good part then I realised
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover

Come on in
I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes I crawl back into your open arms

A Whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone?

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards?
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone?

I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost

Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

A Rush Of Blood To The Head
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls

Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
Do back the things it did to you in return

Ah ah ah ah

He said, I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey
All the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

He said, I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why

So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh to the head

Honey
All the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on
As you mean to go on


Amsterdam
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets

Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
And you came along
And you cut me loose

You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose
