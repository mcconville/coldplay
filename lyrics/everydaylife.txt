Church

What can I tell you?
When I'm with you, I'm walking on air
Watching you sleeping there, yeah
But what can't I get through?
And for everyone, everywhere
You're answering every prayer

And when you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're setting your sail
Oh, can I be your seventh sea?
When you're riding a wave
Oh, when you're riding a wave

'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church
'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church

When you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're riding a wave

Trouble In Town

Trouble in town
Because they cut my brother down
Because my sister can't wear her crown
There's trouble, there's trouble in town
Blood on the beat (Oh-oh)
Oh my goodness, there's blood on the beat
Law of the jungle or the law of the street
There's blood on, there's blood on the beat

And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I never get released

Broken

Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-oh
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm

Lord, when I'm broken (When I'm broken)
And I'm in need (I'm in need)
Feel that ocean (Feel that ocean)
Swallowing me (Swallowing me)
Head is hanging (Head is hanging)
So sorrowfully (So sorrowfully)
Oh Lord (Ooh-ooh)
Come shine your light on me (Shine your light on me)

On that morning (On that morning)
Scared and blue (Scared and blue)
When I'm hungry (When I'm hungry)
And thirsty too (Thirsty too)
Send this raindrop (Send this raindrop)
Down to the sea (Down to the sea)
Oh Lord (Ooh-ooh)
Come shine your light on me (Shine your light on me)

Oh, shine your light (Oh, shine your light)
Oh, shine a light (Oh, shine a light)
And I know (Ooh-ooh)
That in the darkness I'm alright (I'm alright)
See there's no sun rising (Ooh-ooh)
But inside I'm free (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause the Lord will shine a light for me
(Shine a light on me)
Oh, the Lord will shine a light on me
(Shine your light on me)
Sing it now

Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-oh
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-oh
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-oh
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm

Daddy

Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you wanna say?

I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say

You're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
I'm okay

Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look, Dad, we got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I wanna say

Is you're so far away
Oh, and you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
It's okay

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) You're so far away

Won't you come and won't you stay?
Please stay, oh, please stay
Won't you come and won't you stay?
One day, just one day

WOTW

In a world gone wrong
I shall be strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people
I will not want
My faith is strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people

Our world tonight
Get it right
Holding on to the steeple
Our world tonight
I'm off in light
Wonder of the world, power of the people

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Arabesque

I could be you, you could be me
Two raindrops in the same sea
You could be me, I could be you
Two angles of the same view
And we share the same blood

Comme deux gouttes d’eau
On se ressemble
Comme provenant de la même mère
Comme deux ruisseaux (You could be me)
Qui se rassemblent (I could be you)
Pour faire les grandes rivières
And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood

And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood

Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future

Same fucking blood
Same fucking blood

When I Need A Friend

Holy, Holy
Dove descend
Soft and slowly
When I'm near the end
Holy, Holy
Dark defend
Shield me, show me
When I need a friend

Slowly, slowly
Violence, end
Love reign o'er me
When I need a friend

Hombre, mire
Ah, propiamente
Para toda la gente ha sido motivo de burla
Por que todo el mundo piensa que es una cosa imposible
Que es cuestión de locos
El problema es que todo es increíble
Y la gente no lo acepta

Guns

Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros, we've been doing all the sums
The judgment of this court is we need more guns

Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

Meltdown all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums
Who needs education or A Thousand Splendid Suns?
Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb
Only save your look-alikes and fuck the other ones
It's the opinion of this board that we need more guns

Stop

Orphans

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom boom kah, boom de kah

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon

She went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Indigo up in heaven today
(Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
With bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
She say

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune

But he went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tulips the colour of honey today
(It's true, true, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
With bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
He say

Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again (Yeah)

Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Cherubim, Seraphim soon
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon

Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again

Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I want to be with you 'til the world ends
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom boom kah, boom de kah
Boom

Eko Lyrics

Ah-hmm

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights, corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims going nowhere in millions of cars

Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
Where there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

Yeah
Ah-hmm
Ah-hmm

In Africa
We dance in the water and hold
Each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
And dreamed of his queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride

Cry Cry Cry

Cry, cry, cry, baby
Cry, cry, cry

In a book about the world
Called The Luminous Things
There are trees and flowers glowing
While Jizo Bodhisattva sings

When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side

(Dum-dum-dum) Don't want us to hurt each other (Dum-dum-dum)
Or cause each other pain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum) Don't want to fear what we don't know (Dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum) We're in this together, baby (Dum-dum-dum)
We're as singing is to rain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
So I'll never, ever, ever let you go (Dum-dum-dum)

When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

For your miracles outnumber
All the stars out in the sky

Old friends

Tony was a friend of mine
We were together all the time
He had my back
Once he really saved my life

Sometimes I wanna call him
Say, "Hey, let's stay up 'til morning"

And when I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
I see you, you
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
You come through, you
Time just deepens
Sweetens and mends
Old friends

We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water
Old friends
Hmm, hmm
And there are no ends to old friends
Amen

Children Of Adam

May there be peace and love and perfection throughout all creation, through God
May there be peace and love and perfection throughout all creation, through God

Gi nwa nke chukwu, gini ka ina ekwu
N'ihi ihe nile
Nke chukwu mere

Champion Of The world

I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died at every duel
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"

Oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh oh

I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best at taking flight
But my rocket ship reversed
Oh, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
But I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world

(When I sail) And when I sail
I'm sailing west
(Know I might fail) Knowing I might fail
But still I'm hoping for the best
(In my dreams) And in my dreams
Onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say
"I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best"

Lo lo-lo-lo lo oh
Ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yeah
Lo lo-lo-lo lo

So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I am jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I have E.T. on my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
Now I'm riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world

Everyday life

What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be?
Am I the future or the history?

'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls, everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out

How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother, not my enemy?

'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves, everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life

At first light, throw my arms out, open wide
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Yes

Flags

Talked amongst skeletons this morning
Aside from all the medicine and health
If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same?
Is there something that you'd tell your former self?
There were those that wished they'd spun upon a jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be

To be Pyotr Tchaikovsky
To be free like everyone else
There will be no flags to warn me, no!
'Cause I just want to be myself

You'll let telephone in by a region
Is there any advice that you could give?
When you know you're not like them
Do you know La Varsovienne?
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live

And the Holy Roman Army
Said your heart beats like everyone else
You don't need no flags to tell you who you are
I just want to be myself

La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la

There's an aura that surrounds me
There's a different kind of wealth
And I don't need flags to know you're really something
And I just love you for yourself
Oh, I just love you for yourself

La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
