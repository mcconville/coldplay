Don’t Panic
Bones sinking like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

Bones sinking like stones
All that we fought for
And homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

Oh, all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
'Cause yeah everybody here's got somebody to lean on

Shiver
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention do you
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?

But on and on, from the moment I wake
'Til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care

Oh, did you want me to change?
Well I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?

But on and on, from the moment I wake
'Til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care
If you care

Oh, did you want me to change?
Well I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
And I wanted to say

Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
For you
I will always be waiting

And it's you I see
But you don't see me
And it's you I hear
So loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you

So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me

Spies
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know
Show me the right way to go"

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here I cannot sleep from fear no
I said, "Which way do I turn?"
Oh I forget everything I learn

And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
And if we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us where we sleep
Ah and if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you, no
'Cause they're just spies

Sparks
Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah that's what I'll do

I say, oh
I say, oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I will, yes I will)

I say oh
I cry oh

Yeah I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks

Sing it out

La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh

Yellow
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do

'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, for you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

I's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

Trouble
Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turn to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

Singing that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me


Parachutes
In a haze, a stormy haze
I'll be round
I'll be loving you always, always
Here I am and I'll take my time
Here I am and I'll wait in line always
Always

High Speed
Can anybody fly this thing
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring
We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

Can anybody stop this thing
Before my head explodes
Before my head starts to ring
We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

In high speed
High speed

High speed you on

We Never Change
I wanna live life
And never be cruel
I wanna live life
And be good to you
And I wanna fly
And never come down
And live my life
And have friends around

We never change, do we?
No, no
We never learn, do we?
So I wanna live in a wooden house
I wanna live life and always be true
I wanna live life and be good to you

I wanna fly
And never come down
And live my life
And have friends around

We never change, do we?
No, no
We never learn, do we?
So I wanna live in a wooden house
And making more friends would be easy

Oh and I don't have a soul to save
Yes and I sin every single day
We never change, do we?
We never learn, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out

Everything’s Not Lost
When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulder
I drove the other ones away

So if you ever feel neglected
And if you think all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
Everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

'Cause if you ever feel neglected
If you think all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

If you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

Singing out oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah
Everything's not lost

So come on yeah
Oh oh yeah
Come on yeah
Everything's not lost


Life Is For Living
Now I never meant
To do you wrong
That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way

'Cause my head just aches
When I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for living
We all know
And I don't wanna live it alone
