#### Getting Started

This project plays with the CSS Houdini Paint API you can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Houdini).

The CSS Houdini specifications are only beginning to be adopted by web browsers. I tested my work with the latest versions of Chrome ( version 77 as I write this ).

#### Prerequisites
