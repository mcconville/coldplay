      <div class="explanation">The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety,
        depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control
        and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional
        stability". A high need for stability manifests as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring
        and unconcerned. A low need for stability causes a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic
        individuals, but they can
        be perceived as unstable or insecure.</div>
