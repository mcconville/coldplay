Paradise
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach so
She ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of
Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

And dreams of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh

Lalalalalalalalalalala
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "oh, ohohohoh I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

This could be
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

Charlie Brown
Wooh, ooh ooh ooh

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

Poh ooh ooh

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire a fire a spark
Light a fire a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
Oooh ooh ooh
We'll be glowing in the dark
A-woo-a-wooooo

All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs all the lows, as the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot, we'll be glowing in the dark

Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark

Us Against The World
Oh morning come bursting the clouds amen
Lift off this blindfold let me see again
Bring back the water let your ships roll in
In my heart she left a hole

The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightening strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Like a river to a raindrop I lost a friend
My drunken hazard daniel in a lion's den
And tonight I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain saying

Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

And we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Oh
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Major Minus
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful 'cos nothing they say is true
No don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking round the world

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and
You could hear them climbing the stairs
Got my right side fighting while my left hides under the chairs

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you

U.F.O
Lord I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river's going to flow
It just seems that upstream I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

And that light hits your eyes
I know I swear we'll find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold

Bullets fly split the sky
But that's alright sometimes sunlight comes streaming through the holes

Ohohoh

Princess Of China
Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying 'fast as I can
I got to go, I got to go'
Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
Oh oh oh, ohohohoh

Oh ohohohoh, ohohohohoh, ohohohoh, oh

Once upon a time we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on, and on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side in the same game
Now why d'you have to go
Have to go and throw water on my flame?
I could have been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and worn a ring

I could have been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and worn a ring
But no o o o oh you let me go o o o oh
You stole my star
La, lalala lalalala, lalalalalalala, lalalalalalala,
You stole my star
La, lalala lalalala

'Cos you really hurt me, no you really hurt me
'Cos you really hurt me, no you really hurt me
'Cos you really hurt me, oh-oh you really hurt me
'Cos you really hurt me, oh-oh you really hurt me


Up In Flames
So it's over
This time I know it's gone
Saltwater
Tasted it too long

I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

So it's over
This time you're flying on
This time I know no song
Can stop its lonely burn
Can stop it slowly going

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
We have slowly gone

Can't we pour some water on?

Donâ€™t Let It Break Your Heart
And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call
'When you're tired of racing
And you find you never left the start
Come on baby
Don't let it break your heart'

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball
And a slowly burning tide
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard her call

She said 'When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still you never hit the mark
Even in your rains and shadows
Still we're never going to part
Come on baby
Don't let it break your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh
Don't let it break your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh
Don't let it break your heart

Don't let it break your heart

Up With The Birds
The birds they sang, break of day
'Start again' I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away

The birds they sang, all a choir
'Start again', a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

The sky is blue, dream that lie 'til it's true
Then taking back the punch I threw
My arms turn wings oh those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds

Send me up to that wonderful world
And then I'm up with the birds

Might have to go where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armour might rust in the rain
A simple plot, but I know one day
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot, but I know one day
Good things are coming our way
Oh yeah!
