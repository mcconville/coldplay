Square One
You're in control, is there anywhere you want to go?
You're in control, is there anything you want to know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're travelling

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back

The first line of the first page
To the end in the last place you were looking
From the start in your own way
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
You just want
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
it doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too?
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And then you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult had fired you
You wonder if your chance'll ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one

What If
What if there was no light
Nothing wrong nothing right
What if there was no time
And no reason or rhyme
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel i belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life

Ooh that's right
Let's take a breath and jump over the side
Ooh that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Ooh that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
That's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?

Ooh that's right
Let's take a breath jump over the side
Ooh that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Ooh that's right
Oh
Ooh that's right
Let's take a breath jump over the side
Ooh that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Ooh that's right

White Shadows
When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am

If you ever feel like
Something's missing
Things you never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system a plan

All this noise I'm waking up
All the space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted in a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of a system a plan

All this noise I'm waking up
All the space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted in a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swim out on a sea of faces
The tide of the human races
An answer now is what I need
See it in the new sun rise and
See it break on your horizon
Oh come on love
Stay with me

Fix You
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
I will try to fix you

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face and I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Talk
Oh brother I can't I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you, â€˜cause i don't know what to do
Oh brother I can't  believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh i wanna talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done
Do
Something that's never been done

So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all
Let's talk
Let's talk
Let's talk
Let's talk

X&Y
Trying hard to speak and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can

I dive in at the deep end
You become my best friend
I want to love you, but I don't know if I can
I know something is broken
And I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way I can
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space and singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space and singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh


Speed Of Sound
How long before I get in
Before it starts before I begin?
How long before you decide
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Or before i see things the right way up

All that noise and all that sound
All those places i got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
A sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
Others are puzzles puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah when you see it then you'll understand

All those signs I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh ooh
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Oh when you see it then you'll understand

A Message
My song is love
Love to the loveless shown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'll get that message home

My song is love
My song is love unknown
And I'm on fire for you clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late
On a platform, I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you please come home

My song is love is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home

Low
You see the world in black and white
No colour or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall could fall on me
The parting of the sea
But you mean more mean more to me
Than any colour I can see

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
But nothing is as down or as up as us

You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
Don't you wanna see it come soon?
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silver spoon
Don't you want to see it come down?
There for throwing your arms around
And say, "You're not a moment too soon"

'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Yeah I feel low
Oh no

Oh
'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Yeah I feel low
Oh no

The Hardest Part
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
Was the hardest part
And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
That was the hardest part, oh, oh

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh and I
Oh and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart
Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

You cut me down a tree
And brought it back to me
And that's what made me see
Where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself
You can only blame me

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea

You put me on a line and hung me out to dry
And darling that's when i decide to go see
You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see

And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world and then it took
It took it back from me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

Ooh ah
Ooh ah

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
well that's where I belong
And you belong with me
The streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Ah what good is it to live
With nothing left to give?
Forget but not forgive
Not loving all you see
Ah the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
You belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
Yeah you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea

Twisted Logic
Sunlight opened up my eyes
To see for the first time
It opened them up
And tonight
Rivers will run dry
And not for the first time
Rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers
Looking for life on earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards
But then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards
But then you'll go

Created then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask, who does this belong to?
It belongs to all of us

You'll go backwards, but then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then you'll go forwards
You'll go backwards, but then you'll go forwards again
You'll go backwards, but then you'll go forwards

â€˜Til Kingdom Come
Still my heart and hold my tongue
I feel my time, my time has come
Let me in, unlock the door
I never felt this way before

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

Hold my head inside your hands
I need someone who understands
I need someone, someone who hears
For you I've waited all these years

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my day my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait you'll wait for me

In your tears and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

The wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become

For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my days my days are done
Say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
